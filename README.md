# Enhancing-organ-at-risk-segmentation-with-improved-deep-neural-networks

ABSTRACT: 

Organ at risk (OAR) segmentation is a crucial step for treatment planning and outcome determination in
radiotherapy treatments of cancer patients. Several deep learning based segmentation algorithms have been
developed in recent years, however, U-Net remains the de facto algorithm designed specifically for biomedical
image segmentation and has spawned many variants with known weaknesses. In this study, our goal is to present
simple architectural changes in U-Net to improve its accuracy and generalization properties. Unlike many other
available studies evaluating their algorithms on single center data, we thoroughly evaluate several variations of
U-Net as well as our proposed enhanced architecture on multiple data sets for an extensive and reliable study of
the OAR segmentation problem. Our enhanced segmentation model includes (a)architectural changes in the loss
function, (b)optimization framework, and (c)convolution type. Testing on three publicly available multi-object
segmentation data sets, we achieved an average of 80% dice score compared to the baseline U-Net performance of 63%.
